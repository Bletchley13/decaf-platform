# **DECAF has been moved to [Github](https://github.com/sycurelab/DECAF). We will keep updating the Github repository and decaf on the google code will not be updated any more** #

[DECAF](http://code.google.com/p/decaf-platform/wiki/DECAF)(short for Dynamic Executable Code Analysis Framework) is a binary analysis platform based on QEMU.

This is also the home of the DroidScope dynamic Android malware analysis platform.
DroidScope is now an extension to DECAF.

**CHANGELOG**

**[DECAF 1.9](http://sycurelab.ecs.syr.edu/image/decaf1.9.tar.gz)**


1. Fix bugs in mem\_read/write callback.

2. Add taintcheck\_taint\_virtmem to taint a specified virtual memory region.

3. When the VMI is disabled using "disable-vmi", we provide another solution using the guest driver.The difference
between this two implementation is the time it discovers the new created module.

> enable-vmi: new module is discovered  after it is actually created.

> disable-vmi: new module is discovered before it is actually created.
4. clean up code

**[DECAF 1.8](http://sycurelab.ecs.syr.edu/image/DECAF1.8.tar.gz)**

Fix incorrect keylogger tainting problems

clean code

add unpacker/tracecap plugins.

add trace\_reader which is used to parse trace generated by tracecap.

**[DECAF 1.7](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF1.7.tar.gz)**

Fix memory leakage problems when enable tainting.

Improved VMI and new VMI interfaces,now it support linux/windows and arm/x86 platform.

support for tainted eip check. Only eip of indirect branch is included. Both source eip and target eip can be recorded. now ,only support x86 platform.

Optomized TCG IR tainting and logging.


**[DECAF 1.6](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF1.6.tar.gz)**

Add support for ARM

Add TCG IR logging support( --enable-tcg-ir-log). it's closed by default.

Improved VMI for Linux/Windows.

Improved tainting.

Fix several bugs.

**[DECAF 1.5](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF1.5.tar.gz)**

clean up code

**[DECAF 1.4](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF1.4.tar.gz)**

Update guest driver for linux

Update VMI for windows. The symbols is directly retrieved from memory now.

Update support for ARM target.

**[DECAF 1.3](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF1.3.tar.gz)**

fixed bugs for tainting

add support for vmi ,now we can get rid of guest driver.

**[DECAF 1.2](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF1.2.tar.gz)**

add support for TCG tainting

add callback for network

**[DECAF 1.1](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF1.1.tar.gz)**

fixed a bug that BLOCK\_END/INSN\_END callbacks are missing for
some instructions, due to the block chaining optimization in QEMU.

**[DECAF 1.0](https://decaf-platform.googlecode.com/files/DECAF.tar.gz)**
