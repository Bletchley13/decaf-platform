To demonstrate how DECAF enables and solves various binary analysis problems, we showcase three plugins.By hooking the entries and exits of APIs specified in a configuration file, API Tracer is able to trace the API invocations of a specified process and the pro- cesses spawned from it. Keylogger Detector keeps track of tainted keystrokes propagating in the OS kernel and across user-level pro- cesses to detect keyloggers. Instruction Tracer logs instructions executing within a specified context (such as a user-level process, or a kernel module). These plugins are mostly platform agnostic.
