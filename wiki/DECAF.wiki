=1. Introduction=

DECAF(Dynamic Executable Code Analysis Framework) is the successor to the binary analysis techniques developed for TEMU ( dynamic analysis component of [http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/ BitBlaze] ) as part of [http://lcs.syr.edu/faculty/yin/ Heng Yin]'s work on [http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/ BitBlaze] project headed up by [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/ Dawn Song]. DECAF builds upon TEMU. We appreciate all that worked with us on that project.
